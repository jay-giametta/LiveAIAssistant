### Way Ahead
[Only include actual next steps/action items mentioned. Remove section if none discussed]

[Do not add any additional information that doesn't fit in these categories]
[Do not update me on how well you were able to answer my question or if you did... whatever you add that isn't in the trancript will end up in my notes and cause confusion]

Important: Remove any section headers and placeholders if there is no actual content to include. Do not include template text like "MEETING_TYPE", "ORGANIZATION_1", etc.
